# Ledger Nano Hardware Interface
Cryptocurrency-oriented communities of both enthusiasts and developers alike have begun to embrace the potential of cold-storage wallets (AKA "hardware wallets") for enacting financial transactions while minimizing the risk of scams. In recognition to that same potential, ARCANE TECHNOLOGIESâ„¢ has been in the works for developing special software to interface with the most popular brands of said devices, namely Ledger Nano & Trezor products.

# Libraries
Trezor offers a well-documented API known as the "Trezor Connect API" that is frequently curated and makes smooth the process of connecting to Trezor devices in almost every platform. Its publically-available documentation was the main
resource utilized in the making of this software, in conjunction with the neutralino framework for cross-platform JS-Development of Desktop applications.
